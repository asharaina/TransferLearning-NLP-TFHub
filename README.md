# TransferLearning-NLP-TFHub
This project is my implementation of the Coursera Guided Project - Transfer Learning for NLP with TensorFlow Hub.
I have updated the code of Task 5 (building and compiling the models from TF Hub) from the project's original version to be compatible with the recent versions of TensorFlow.
-The current version of the code executes in CPU mode, but cannot execute in GPU runtime due to XLA compatibility issues
